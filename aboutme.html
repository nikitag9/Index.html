          <p>I'm from Bangalore, the IT capital of India and I'm currently in my third semester at Georgia Tech. 
            I also work as a Teaching Assistant part time for an introductory Computer Science class here at tech.
            In the past I've worked as a web developement and graphic design intern, designed graphics for the GT student magazine,
            and worked as a marketing intern. 
          </p> I'm very interested in User-Experience Design and using my abilities as an artist and coder to help make other people's lives easier. 
            I will be joining The Home Depot in the summer of 2022 to work as a User Experience Designer and I'm very excited to be able to work on real-world projects!
            In the future, I would love to use my UX design skills and psychology background to design interfaces that help people with disabilities use platforms easier. 
            In my free time I like experimenting with graphic design, VR, animation, and game design.
            Away from my computer I also love drawing, baking, going on walks, staring at the Atlanta skyline, and signing up for every event on campus.
